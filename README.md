# WELCOME
Be welcome to the first Python workshop imparted at Universidad de Guanajuato by students to students to dabble in the marvels of the Data Science and the Geoinformatic; **"PYTHON: BASIC CONCEPTS APPLIED TO GEOINFORMATIC"**.  
At the finish of the workshop I hope to have incresead your curiosity about the application wide field of the programming into the Geosciences and give you the needed basis to implement a powerful tool along your labor life as a professional of the matter.  
  
In the current repository you will find the files that will be needed to follow the explanation along the workshop.  
**_script.py_** file has the practice exercises. On the other hand, **SMN_1151.txt** file has the complementary data to carry out workshop. I recommend you to download both files before the start of the same.  
  
Along the workshop we going to be using **_Visual Studio Code_** as the code interprete. However, you are free to use the any other code intepreter of your preference. If you do not have one yet in the **_Instalation_ folder** you will find a manual to install and configure **_VS CODE_** for Python.  
  
Do not hesitate to contact me for any doubt or comment.
