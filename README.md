# WELCOME
Be welcome to the first Python workshop imparted at Universidad de Guanajuato by students to students to dabble in the marvels of the Data Science and the Geoinformatic fields; **"PYTHON: BASIC CONCEPTS APPLIED TO GEOINFORMATIC"**.  
I hope to increase 

In the current repository you will find the files that will be needed to follow the explanation along the workshop.  
**_script.py_** file has the practice exercises. On the other hand, **SMN_1151.txt** file has the complementary data to carry out workshop. I recommend you to download both files before the start of the workshop.  
  
Along the workshop we going to be using **_Visual Studio Code_** as the code interprete. However, you are free to use the code intepreter of your preference. If you do not have one yet in **_Instalation_ folder** you will find a manual to install and configure **_VS CODE_** to Python.  
Do not hense to contact me for any doubt.
