# WELCOME
Be welcome to the first Python workshop imparted at Universidad de Guanajuato; **"PYTHON: BASIC CONCEPTS APPLIED TO GEOINFORMATIC"**.  
  
In the current repository you will find the files that will be needed to follow the explanation along the workshop.  
**_script.py_** file has the practice exercises. On the other hand, **SMN_1151.txt** file has the complementary data to carry out workshop. I recommend you to download those before the start of the workshop.
